## **M﻿otivation**

N﻿owadays, chronic diseases have been a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, current health information systems still focus on one-time or sudden illness, which fail to provide continuous management of patients with chronic diseases. One of the reasons for this is that the  system cannot provide comprehensive patient information (including medical history, diagnosis records).

I﻿n order to tackle with this problem,  with the machine learning methods and good  database table design, I design and implement a information system for gathering and analysing crucial health information required by chronic disease treatment experts.

## **I﻿dea**

T﻿raditional health information system cannot fully meet the needs of chronic disease management due to lack of system framework design in health field. 

[*Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research* (*CFIR*)](https://cfirguide.org/) provides a comprehensive menu of constructs to guide health implementions, which can help to design system modules functions. I combined CFIR and traditional systems analysis methods to design and implement this HIS to meet the chronic disease management needs.
