title: "Generative Artificial Intelligence Governance Action Framework: Content
  Analysis Based on AIGC Incident Report Texts"
abstract: >-
  [Purpose/Significance] The breakthrough of Generative Artificial
  Intelligence（Generative AI）has led to the explosive growth

  of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content （AIGC）, which inevitably cause people to be negatively affected by information overload,

  information noise, information security, and other related issues, making social information governance face new challenges. This paper

  aims to analyze and discuss the characteristic attributes of AIGC incidents, so as to provide a reference for Generative AI governance in

  China. [Design/Methodology] Based on AI Incident Database（AIID）and taking AIGC-related incident reports as samples for content

  analysis, the types, causes, damage objects and countermeasures of existing AIGC incidents were discussed. [Findings/Conclusion] The

  diversity of the objects affected by AIGC incidents, the wide distribution of the scope, and the complex unknown of the potential harm, result

  in the resources and capabilities of any single actor not being able to effectively deal with the crisis. It is necessary for actors of government,

  enterprises and society to form a governance participation model of "diversity + coordination + checks and balances", and to carry out

  information governance under the action framework of "context-consciousness-action". [Originality/Value] This paper introduces AIID

  as a case source database, provides an intuitive demonstration of the relevant details of existing AIGC incidents and forms a three-level

  category framework for AIGC incident analysis through content analysis.The action frame of Generative AI governance formed in this study

  is helpful to promote the exploration and practice of Generative AI governance from a macro perspective.
